# Slack Themer

This is a couple of neat scripts that will theme slack (OSX only  currently). 

To theme your Slack run the following command:

`yarn install-theme <theme-name>` 
 
 -- or --
 
 `npm run install-theme <theme-name>`
 
 To un-theme your Slack run:
 
 `yarn uninstall-theme`
 
 -- or --
 
 `npm run uninstall-theme`
 
 The available themes are:
 
 - dark
 - one-dark
 - low-contrast
 - navy
 
 To add your own themes, add an entry to the themes.json file in the themes folder.
 
 The code for this was borrowed from https://github.com/widget-/slack-black-theme and is mostly just an installer/uninstaller for that.
